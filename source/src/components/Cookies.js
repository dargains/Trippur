    <p className="title">What is the purpose of a cookie?</p>
    <p>Cookies are very useful and do lots of different jobs that help to make your experience of a website smoother and more enjoyable. You could say they're like a website’s ‘memories’ of you, helping it recall how you’ve navigated around its pages, and the choices you’ve made along the way. A website that remembers you is much easier and faster to navigate than one that doesn’t. That’s why most of the websites you know use cookies.</p>

    <p className="title">What’s in a cookie?</p>
    <p>A cookie is a simple piece of information in the form of a very small text file. Each and every cookie is unique and comprised of the name of the website that created it and a one-of-a-kind string of digits and letters. The vast majority of websites and apps place cookies on your device’s hard drive (computer, mobile phone or tablet) as you browse them. They do this through your web browser – for example, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari or Firefox. A cookie is only readable and retrievable by the website that created it; websites are never able to share information through cookies. Some cookies only last for the duration of your visit. These ‘session cookies’ disappear from your computer or mobile device when you close your browser. Other cookies stay on your computer or mobile device after your browser has closed and last for a specified amount of time. These ‘persistent cookies’ are activated each time you visit the site that generated them. What’s not in a cookie? Cookies do NOT contain: Personal information – you cannot be personally identified from a cookie Programme code – unlike a computer virus, a cookie is not comprised of code, which means it is incapable of harming your device</p>

    <p className="title">Are cookies dangerous?</p>
    <p>No Cookies are small and simple strings of characters known as text files. They are not computer programs. They cannot read your personal information. They can’t spread a computer virus. Cookies are unable to harm your device, and they pose no threat to your privacy.</p>
