    <p className="title">FAQ</p>
    <p className="title">DOES TRIPPUR SELL TICKETS?</p>
    <p>No, we don’t sell tickets and you don’t book directly on our site. You book your flight, hotel, or holiday deal on the company’s site which we’ve directed you to.</p>

    <p className="title">WHOM SHOULD I CONTACT WITH QUESTIONS REGARDING BOOKING?</p>
    <p>If you experience problems with a booking and/or want to change it, you must contact the company you booked with. In case you’re not sure which company, you can find out by looking at the booking confirmation e-mail that you received from the company. You can also look at your checking account, where you can see which company debited the money. Trippur doesn’t have any information about your booking, and therefore we unfortunately can’t change it and/or send you any confirmation about your booking.</p>

    <p className="title">WHAT SHOULD I CHECK BEFORE BOOKING A FLIGHT?</p>
    <p>Before clicking on the ‘Buy’ button on a company’s site you should always (double) check that you’ve given the correct information such as: Travel dates Departure and arrival airports Number of passengers Names of passengers Email</p>

    <p className="title">DO YOU INCLUDE FEES IN THE PRICES?</p>
    <p>We do our best to include all mandatory fees and surcharges (fees that cannot be deselected) in the prices which we display. Our goal is to create as much transparency in prices as possible and we’re constantly working on making the prices more transparent. The challenge for us is all the (hidden) and constantly changing extra fees which the companies add to their prices. We’ve begun displaying overviews of the non-mandatory fees and surcharges which the different companies add to their prices. These overviews are shown together with the specific company and we want to display a fee-list for each company on our site.</p>

    <p className="title">DOES TRIPPUR RAISE PRICES ON FLIGHT TICKETS?</p>
    <p>No, absolutely not! Trippur never tracks your IP address or uses cookies to push prices up. We make real-time, live searches and find the best prices available at the time of your search. We have no intentions of pushing up prices, because we always want you to be able to find the best and cheapest prices available.</p>

    <p className="title">WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I EXPERIENCE INACCURATE INFORMATION ON TRIPPUR?</p>
    <p>Our goal is always to show the cheapest prices and accurate information. Therefore we’d really appreciate if you would please inform us via our Feedback if you experience that we display information which is incorrect. Then we’ll look into the issue and take action.</p>

    <p className="title">HOW DO I GIVE THE MOST USEFUL FEEDBACK ON TRIPPUR?</p>
    <p>Your feedback is very valuable to us because it helps us improve our services. If you contact us, then please give us as much information as possible about your search including travel dates and destinations, as well as the name of company we’ve directed you. This information makes it easier for us to look into an issue and take action.</p>
